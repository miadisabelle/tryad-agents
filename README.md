A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges AI assistants with [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), featuring **authentic creative process support** based on Robert Fritz's "Creating Your Life" framework.

## üéØ **NEW: CREATE Tool - Authentic Creative Process**

Transform your creative work with Fritz's proven three-phase framework:
- **üå± Germination**: Initial excitement, vision clarification, balanced action
- **‚ö° Assimilation**: Structural tension, momentum building, natural movement  
- **‚ú® Completion**: Finishing touches, successful conclusion

**Creative Orientation**: "What do you want to create?" (not "What problem to solve?")

## Core Features

‚úÖ **Claude + Gemini Integration**: Bridge AI assistants with Gemini's massive context window  
‚úÖ **CREATE Tool**: Authentic creative process based on Robert Fritz's framework  
‚úÖ **File Analysis**: Use `@` syntax for large codebases and files  
‚úÖ **Sandbox Mode**: Safe code execution and testing  
‚úÖ **Change Mode**: Structured code edits with OLD/NEW format

## Quick Overview

[![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=fff)](#) + [![Google Gemini](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Gemini-886FBF?logo=googlegemini&logoColor=fff)](#) + üé® **Creative Process**

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16.0.0 or higher)
2. **[Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** installed and configured


## Installation

### One-Line Setup (Recommended)

```bash
claude mcp add coaia-gemini-cli -- npx -y coaia-gemini-mcp-tool
```

### Verify Installation

Type `/mcp` inside Claude Code to verify the `coaia-gemini-cli` MCP is active.

---

### Alternative: Import from Claude Desktop

If you already have it configured in Claude Desktop:

1. Add to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
"coaia-gemini-cli": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "coaia-gemini-mcp-tool"]
}
```

2. Import to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

## Configuration

Register the MCP server with your MCP client:

### For NPX Usage (Recommended)

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coaia-gemini-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "coaia-gemini-mcp-tool"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Global Installation

If you installed globally, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coaia-gemini-cli": {
      "command": "coaia-gemini-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration File Locations:**

- **Claude Desktop**:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

After updating the configuration, restart your terminal session.

## Example Workflow

- **Natural language**: "use gemini to explain index.html", "create a mobile app using the create tool", "ask gemini to search for latest news"
- **Claude Code**: Type `/coaia-gemini-cli` and commands will populate in Claude Code's interface.

## Usage Examples

### üé® CREATE Tool - Authentic Creative Process

Transform your creative work with the three-phase framework:

#### Germination Phase
```
"I want to create a mobile app that helps people track their creative projects"
- desiredOutcome: "Create a mobile app that helps people track creative projects with inspiration features"
- currentReality: "I have programming skills but no mobile app experience"
- creativePhase: "germination"
```

#### Assimilation Phase
```
"Help me build momentum on my app project"
- desiredOutcome: "Launch beta version with 50 active users" 
- currentReality: "Working prototype, 5 friends testing and giving feedback"
- creativePhase: "assimilation"
```

#### Completion Phase
```
"Bring my app to successful launch"
- desiredOutcome: "Polished app ready for App Store"
- currentReality: "Beta tested, 4.2 stars, final bugs being fixed"
- creativePhase: "completion"
```

### With File References (using @ syntax)

- `ask gemini to analyze @src/main.js and explain what it does`
- `use gemini to summarize @. the current directory`
- `analyze @package.json and tell me about dependencies`

### General Questions (without files)

- `ask gemini to search for the latest tech news`
- `use gemini to explain div centering`
- `ask gemini about best practices for React development related to @file_im_confused_about`

### Using Gemini CLI's Sandbox Mode (-s)

The sandbox mode allows you to safely test code changes, run scripts, or execute potentially risky operations in an isolated environment.

- `use gemini sandbox to create and run a Python script that processes data`
- `ask gemini to safely test @script.py and explain what it does`
- `use gemini sandbox to install numpy and create a data visualization`
- `test this code safely: Create a script that makes HTTP requests to an API`
